4. **How does dependency injection work in .NET 6?** (Answered)
5. **What are the different types of middleware in ASP.NET Core?**
   - Request-handling components.
   - Built-in: Authentication, Routing, CORS, etc.
   - Custom middleware can be created.
   - Executes in a pipeline (request-response cycle).
   
6. **Explain the concept of minimal APIs introduced in .NET 6.**
   - Lightweight APIs without controllers.
   - Uses top-level statements.
   - Ideal for small microservices.
   - Supports attributes for routing.

7. **What is the role of the `appsettings.json` file?**
   - Stores configuration settings.
   - Supports multiple environments (e.g., `appsettings.Development.json`).
   - Values are loaded at runtime.
   - Can be bound to classes.

8. **How do you configure logging in a .NET 6 Web API?**
   - Built-in logging provider.
   - Configure in `Program.cs`.
   - Supports file, console, and third-party loggers.
   - Use `ILogger` to log in code.

9. **What is the purpose of the `IHostBuilder` interface?**
   - Configures and builds a host.
   - Registers services and dependencies.
   - Manages the application's lifecycle.
   - Used in ASP.NET Core apps.

10. **Describe the difference between `IServiceCollection` and `IServiceProvider`.**
   - `IServiceCollection`: registers services.
   - `IServiceProvider`: resolves services.
   - `IServiceCollection` is used during startup.
   - `IServiceProvider` is used at runtime.

### ASP.NET Core Web API
11. **What is a Web API, and how does it differ from a traditional web application?** (Answered)
12. **How do you create a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core?** (Answered)
13. **What are HTTP verbs, and how are they used in Web APIs?** (Answered)
14. **Explain routing in ASP.NET Core Web APIs.**
    - Defines how requests match to endpoints.
    - Convention-based and attribute-based routing.
    - Can specify route templates in controllers.
    - Supports constraints and optional parameters.

15. **What is attribute routing, and how does it differ from conventional routing?**
    - Define routes directly on controllers/actions.
    - Use `[Route]` and `[HttpVerb]` attributes.
    - More explicit and flexible than conventional routing.
    - Ideal for complex APIs.

16. **How can you implement versioning in a Web API?** (Answered)
17. **What are response types in ASP.NET Core Web API?**
    - Defines what type of response is returned.
    - Use `ActionResult` to return different types.
    - JSON is the default response format.
    - Supports `Ok`, `BadRequest`, `NotFound`, etc.

18. **How do you handle exceptions globally in a Web API?**
    - Use `ExceptionMiddleware`.
    - Implement a global exception handler.
    - Customize exception responses.
    - Log errors in production environments.

19. **What is CORS, and how do you enable it in ASP.NET Core?**
    - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
    - Controls API access from different origins.
    - Enable in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`.
    - Use `AddCors` and configure policies.

20. **How can you secure a Web API using JWT authentication?** (Answered)
