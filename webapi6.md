### Data Handling  
66. **How do you validate incoming data in a Web API?**  
   - Use **Data Annotations** like `[Required]`, `[MaxLength]`, etc., on models.
   - Implement **custom validation attributes** for complex logic.
   - Use `FluentValidation` for a more flexible validation approach.
   - Ensure proper validation logic in action methods using `ModelState.IsValid`.

67. **What is model binding in ASP.NET Core?**  
   - Converts HTTP request data into action method parameters.
   - Supports binding from query strings, form data, route data, and JSON bodies.
   - Automatic binding of complex objects like models and lists.
   - Use attributes like `[FromBody]`, `[FromQuery]`, etc., for specific binding sources.

68. **Explain the difference between model binding and model validation.**  
   - **Model Binding** maps HTTP request data to parameters or objects.
   - **Model Validation** checks if the bound data meets required conditions.
   - Validation happens after binding; they work together in the pipeline.
   - Example: Binding JSON to a model, then validating required fields.

69. **How can you map between DTOs and entities?**  
   - Use **AutoMapper** to simplify mapping between objects.
   - Manually map properties in a service layer if needed for fine control.
   - DTOs decouple API models from database entities, improving security.
   - Example: `AutoMapper.Map<Dto>(entity)` converts entity to DTO.

70. **What are pagination and filtering, and how do you implement them?**  
   - **Pagination** retrieves a subset of data (e.g., using `Skip` and `Take`).
   - **Filtering** narrows results based on specific criteria (e.g., using LINQ).
   - Implement by passing query parameters (e.g., `page`, `size`, `filter`) in API calls.
   - Example: `context.Orders.Skip(page * size).Take(size).ToList()` for pagination.

### Asynchronous Programming  
71. **What is async/await, and why is it important?**  
   - Async/await allows non-blocking, asynchronous programming.
   - Improves performance by freeing up threads during I/O-bound tasks.
   - Keeps the API responsive while waiting for external resources (e.g., database, APIs).
   - Example: `await Task.Delay(1000)` pauses asynchronously without blocking the thread.

72. **How do you handle exceptions in asynchronous methods?**  
   - Wrap async code in `try-catch` blocks for proper error handling.
   - Handle `AggregateException` for parallel tasks using `Task.WhenAll`.
   - Use `async` versions of exception filters and middlewares in Web APIs.
   - Example: `try { await MyAsyncMethod(); } catch (Exception ex) { ... }`.

73. **Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming.**  
   - **Synchronous:** Executes code sequentially, blocking until completion.
   - **Asynchronous:** Executes code without waiting for tasks to finish.
   - Async programming improves scalability and performance in Web APIs.
   - Example: Database access (`await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync()`) is async to avoid blocking.

74. **What are the benefits of using asynchronous programming in a Web API?**  
   - Frees up threads for other tasks, improving scalability.
   - Prevents thread blocking during long-running I/O operations.
   - Enhances overall responsiveness, especially under high load.
   - Reduces resource consumption by handling many requests efficiently.

75. **How do you implement parallel processing in .NET 6?**  
   - Use `Task.WhenAll` to run multiple tasks concurrently.
   - `Parallel.ForEach` can handle collections in parallel.
   - **Data parallelism** for processing large datasets concurrently.
   - Example: `await Task.WhenAll(tasks)` runs tasks in parallel.

### Logging and Monitoring  
76. **What are the logging providers available in ASP.NET Core?**  
   - Built-in providers like **Console**, **Debug**, and **EventLog**.
   - Third-party providers like **Serilog**, **NLog**, and **Log4Net**.
   - Configure multiple providers in `appsettings.json`.
   - Supports structured logging for easier searching and filtering.

77. **How can you implement structured logging?**  
   - Use a logging framework like **Serilog** or **NLog**.
   - Log data in key-value pairs, making logs searchable and filterable.
   - Include context-specific information like `userId`, `transactionId`, etc.
   - Example: `Log.Information("User {UserId} made a request", userId)`.

78. **What is Application Insights, and how do you use it?**  
   - Azure-based service for monitoring and logging applications.
   - Provides real-time telemetry, error reporting, and performance tracking.
   - Easy integration with ASP.NET Core for capturing request/response logs.
   - Supports custom events and metrics for detailed analysis.

79. **How do you monitor performance and health of a Web API?**  
   - Use health checks to monitor the status of APIs, databases, and external services.
   - Integrate **Application Insights** or **Prometheus** for real-time metrics.
   - Use **APM** (Application Performance Monitoring) tools to track response times and errors.
   - Regularly review logs and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks.

80. **What are the best practices for logging in a Web API?**  
   - Log at different levels: Information, Warning, Error, and Critical.
   - Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, PII).
   - Use structured logs for better queryability and filtering.
   - Centralize logs using tools like ELK Stack, Azure Monitor, or Splunk.
