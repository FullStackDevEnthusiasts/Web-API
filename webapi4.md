### Testing  
36. **How do you unit test a Web API in .NET 6?**  
   - Use a test framework like xUnit or NUnit.
   - Mock dependencies using Moq or a similar library.
   - Test controllers by calling actions directly.
   - Use `Assert` to verify expected results.

37. **What is the role of mocking in testing?**  
   - Simulates dependencies for isolated unit testing.
   - Prevents reliance on external systems (e.g., databases, APIs).
   - Allows you to test different scenarios easily.
   - Examples include mocking a repository or service layer.

38. **How can you test controllers and services in a Web API?**  
   - Test controllers using mock dependencies.
   - Call actions directly and assert results.
   - Services can be tested similarly by mocking external dependencies.
   - Ensure validation, business logic, and return values are tested.

39. **What tools do you use for testing a .NET Web API?**  
   - Unit testing: xUnit, NUnit, MSTest.
   - Mocking: Moq, NSubstitute.
   - Integration testing: TestServer, Postman, or Swagger.
   - Performance testing: Apache JMeter, Visual Studio Load Test.

40. **How do you perform integration testing in ASP.NET Core?**  
   - Use `WebApplicationFactory` for creating test server.
   - Simulate real HTTP requests to the API.
   - Test end-to-end including routing, model binding, etc.
   - Ensure database or external API dependencies are properly mocked or isolated.

### Performance  
41. **What are some techniques to improve the performance of a Web API?**  
   - Use asynchronous methods (`async/await`).
   - Implement response caching for static data.
   - Optimize database queries with indexes and projections.
   - Compress responses to reduce payload size.

42. **How do you implement caching in ASP.NET Core?**  
   - Use `ResponseCache` attribute for caching HTTP responses.
   - Implement `IMemoryCache` or `IDistributedCache` for data caching.
   - Cache frequently accessed data or computations.
   - Caching reduces load on database and improves response times.

43. **Explain the concept of response compression.**  
   - Compress API responses to reduce data size.
   - Enabled using `ResponseCompression` middleware.
   - Supports formats like Gzip and Brotli.
   - Improves load times for clients with slow connections.

44. **How can you measure the performance of a Web API?**  
   - Use logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Application Insights).
   - Profile performance with diagnostic tools in Visual Studio.
   - Measure response times, request/second, and resource usage.
   - Identify bottlenecks like slow queries or large payloads.

45. **What are the implications of using async/await in a Web API?**  
   - Frees up threads during I/O operations (non-blocking).
   - Improves scalability by handling more concurrent requests.
   - Simplifies code compared to traditional threading.
   - Careful error handling is required to avoid deadlocks.

### Deployment  
46. **What are the different ways to deploy a .NET 6 Web API?**  
   - Deploy to IIS or Kestrel on Windows or Linux.
   - Host on cloud platforms like Azure or AWS.
   - Containerize and deploy using Docker.
   - Use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

47. **How do you configure your Web API for production?**  
   - Set environment variables for sensitive configurations.
   - Use `appsettings.Production.json` for production settings.
   - Enable logging and monitoring for real-time insights.
   - Configure security measures like HTTPS and JWT.

48. **What is the role of Docker in deploying .NET applications?**  
   - Enables containerization for consistent environments.
   - Simplifies deployment across different platforms (Windows, Linux).
   - Use Dockerfile to define how the app is built and run.
   - Supports orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

49. **How do you use Azure for hosting a .NET 6 Web API?**  
   - Use Azure App Service for hosting web apps and APIs.
   - Integrate with Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB for data storage.
   - Use Azure Functions for serverless APIs.
   - Monitor with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

50. **Explain the concept of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) in .NET.**  
   - CI/CD automates build, test, and deployment processes.
   - Tools like GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps manage pipelines.
   - Ensures code is automatically tested and deployed to production.
   - Reduces manual errors and accelerates release cycles.
