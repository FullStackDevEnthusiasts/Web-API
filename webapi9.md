### Configuration  
111. **How do you manage different configurations for development and production?**  
   - Use **`appsettings.json`** for general configuration.
   - Use **`appsettings.Development.json`** and **`appsettings.Production.json`** for environment-specific settings.
   - Override settings using **environment variables** or command-line arguments.
   - Example: `dotnet run --environment Production` to use production settings.

112. **What is the role of environment variables in ASP.NET Core?**  
   - Store configuration settings that differ by environment (e.g., database connection strings).
   - Provide a way to manage sensitive information securely.
   - Override settings from configuration files and `appsettings.json`.
   - Example: `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production` sets the environment.

113. **Explain the use of `IConfiguration` interface.**  
   - Provides access to configuration data from various sources (e.g., JSON files, environment variables).
   - Allows hierarchical access to settings, such as `Configuration["Section:Key"]`.
   - Supports configuration binding to POCO classes.
   - Example: `var value = configuration["MySetting"];`.

114. **How can you bind configuration settings to a class?**  
   - Define a class with properties that match the configuration structure.
   - Use **`IOptions<T>`** to bind configuration sections to the class.
   - Configure in `Startup.cs` with `services.Configure<MySettings>(Configuration.GetSection("MySettings"));`.
   - Example: `var settings = options.Value;` to access bound settings.

115. **What is the options pattern in ASP.NET Core?**  
   - A pattern for managing and validating configuration settings.
   - Bind configuration sections to strongly-typed classes using **`IOptions<T>`**.
   - Provides a central location for configuration management and validation.
   - Example: `services.Configure<MyOptions>(Configuration.GetSection("MyOptions"));`.

   - Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
   - Example: Use `git commit -m "message"` to save changes and `git push` to share them.

119. **How do you use Docker for .NET applications?**  
   - Package .NET applications in **Docker containers** for consistency across environments.
   - Use **Dockerfiles** to define build and runtime environments.
   - Deploy containers to any platform supporting Docker, including cloud providers.
   - Example: `docker run -d -p 80:80 myapp` to run the application in a container.

120. **What are the benefits of using Visual Studio Code for .NET development?**  
   - **Lightweight**: Faster start-up and lower resource consumption compared to full IDEs.
   - **Cross-platform**: Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - **Extension support**: Enhances functionality with .NET-specific extensions.
   - **Integrated terminal**: Provides direct access to command-line tools and build processes.
